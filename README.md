# WeatherDownThere

A Django web application built to show the weather at upcoming concerts for artists and venues!

WeatherDownThere parses and saves data from the TicketMaster API to conduct searches for artists, venues, and events. 


That data is then cross-referenced with the JSON data obtained from OpenWeatherMap API to get and display the weather for the venue/event.


# Home
### Home Page displays the upcoming events found in database and displays no results if the database isn't populated.
